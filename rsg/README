* Your task:

Implement the missing code to produce a working program, one which is able
to read-in a grammar file and then produce three random sentences from that
grammar.

You should not need to modify the interfaces provided, but you may (will?) 
need to write helper fuctions. You should try really, really hard to think 
about how you might approach the problem from a C++ perspective rather than
a C perspective. Make use of C++ library features whenever possible, in 
particular, parsing the grammar file should be quite easy if you use the 
C++ I/O functionality properly!

A few grammars are provided for testing, but you should devise your own
test cases and additional grammars. 

Good luck!
